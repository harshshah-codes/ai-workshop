# About the Prompts section
This section provides practical techniques for crafting effective prompts when working with AI coding assistants like GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude, and other Large Language Models (LLMs).

## Fundamentals of Prompt Engineering

### Understanding How AI Coding Assistants Work

AI coding assistants work by predicting the most likely continuation of a given text. They've been trained on vast amounts of code and documentation, allowing them to:

1. Generate code based on natural language descriptions
2. Complete partially written code
3. Suggest solutions based on context
4. Translate between programming languages
5. Explain or document existing code

### The CRISPE Framework for Effective Prompts

For software development, we recommend following the CRISPE framework:

- **C**apacity and Role: Define what you want the AI to be or do
- **R**equest: Clearly state what you want the AI to produce
- **I**nformation: Provide necessary context and specifications
- **S**pecificity: Include details that constrain the solution
- **P**erspective: Offer examples or approaches you prefer
- **E**valuation: Ask for explanation, alternatives, or improvements
