# Session 1: Introduction to AI-Enhanced Software Development

## Session Overview

**Duration**: 1 hour
**Format**: Conversational dialogue between instructors with hands-on activities
**Objectives**: 
- Introduce the changing landscape of software development
- Provide an overview of AI tools for coding
- Establish fundamental software engineering principles
- Define guidelines for effective AI use and validation
- Outline learning processes for software engineers in the AI era

### 1. The Changing Landscape 
- Shift from specialized roles to full-stack capabilities
- Increased complexity and pace of technology evolution
- Change in learning pathways (just-in-time vs comprehensive)
- Industry expectations vs. academic preparation

### 2. AI Tools Overview
- Claude 3.5 chat based coding
- Visual Studio Code IDE with GitHub Copilot for IDE based coding
- Bolt
- MPCRun in multiple modes

### 3. Participant Hands-on Activity
**Guiding Questions for Participants**:
- How did the AI tool interpret your instructions?
- What modifications did you need to make to the generated code?
- What surprised you about the interaction?

### 4. When to Use AI (and When Not To)
1. "Based on your experience, when do you find AI most valuable in the development process?"
2. "When have you found AI tools to be a hindrance rather than a help?"
3. "How do we balance learning fundamentals vs. leveraging AI tools?"
4. "What risks should developers be aware of when using these tools?"

**Key Points Covered**: 
- AI strengths (boilerplate, documentation, exploration)
- AI weaknesses (complex algorithms, security-critical code)
- Educational considerations (fundamentals vs tools)
- Ethical and legal considerations
