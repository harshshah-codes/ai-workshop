# Navigating Software Development in the Age of AI

Welcome to the official repository for the "Navigating Software Development in the Age of AI" workshop, conducted by Rahul Kulkarni [DoNew](https://www.godonew.com/) and Dr. Jayakrishnan M [CODE, IIT Madras](https://code.iitm.ac.in/).

## About This Workshop

Software development is undergoing a paradigm shift with the integration of AI tools. This workshop equips participants with the knowledge and skills to leverage AI for enhanced productivity and quality across the software development lifecycle.

Instead of merely prescribing tools for specific tasks, we focus on "learning how to learn" - empowering you to discover, evaluate, and incorporate the latest AI tools as they evolve.

## Workshop Format

The workshop is structured as four interactive sessions:

### Session 1: Introduction and Foundation
- The changing landscape of software development
- Overview of AI tools for coding
- Fundamental software engineering principles
- Guidelines for effective AI use and validation
- Learning processes for software engineers in the AI era

### Session 2: 


### Session 3: 


### Session 4:

## Learning Philosophy

Our approach is based on several key principles:

1. **System Thinking**: Focus on architecture and goals rather than syntax
2. **Learning Through Application**: Hands-on activities in every session
3. **Iterative Development**: Rapid experimentation with AI assistance
4. **Collaborative Learning**: Shared knowledge and peer feedback
5. **First Principles**: Understanding fundamentals before implementation

## Who Is This Workshop For?

- **Beginners**: Learn to use AI for setting up development environments and building simple applications
- **Students**: Quickly find and synthesize research, understand code, and become productive in domain-specific tasks
- **Recent Graduates**: Transcend specialization boundaries by leveraging AI to work across the stack
- **Professionals**: Elevate quality through AI-assisted code reviews, design pattern suggestions, and automated testing
- **Educators**: Discover how to embrace AI in classrooms to enhance teaching and learning experiences

## Repository Structure

This repository serves as a living document that will evolve throughout the workshop. It contains:

- Session guides and materials
- Code examples demonstrating AI-enhanced development
- Tutorials for various AI tools and techniques
- Prompt collections for different coding tasks
- Resources and reference materials
- Space for participant contributions

## AI Acknowledgement
This repository was developed with assistance from AI tools, specifically Claude 3.7 Sonnet. We believe in transparency regarding AI use in educational materials, especially for a workshop about AI-enhanced development.
For details about how AI was used, human oversight involved, and usage considerations, please see [AI-ACKNOWLEDGEMENT](AI-ACKNOWLEDGEMENT.md).

We encourage workshop participants to adopt similar transparency practices in their own AI-assisted projects. This includes:

- Documenting which parts of a project received AI assistance
- Describing the human review and validation process
- Noting the specific AI tools and configurations used
- Providing usage considerations for others

This transparency builds trust, educates others about responsible AI use, and models the thoughtful integration of AI into development workflows that we advocate throughout this workshop.
